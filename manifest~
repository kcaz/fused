TOP LEVEL: 

    fused_reg.py: this file contains core code for fitting fused linear models for gene regulatory networks. Things that should go here are
    	-code for solving grn
	-any data structures needed to solve grn
	-code for generating/manipulating constraints from data. This is a little bit ugly, but some of the solver code needs to generate constraints, so it's best placed here.

		
    data_sources.py: this file is a list of classes implementing a data_source interface. Also contains code for generating random data, which should be saved to files and then dealt with as data in a standard format. data_sources should
    	-return organism names
	-return (ordered) gene names for each organism
	-return (ordered) tf names for each organism
	-return expression matrices for each organism
	-return tf expression matrices for each organism
	-return orthology lists
	-return priors
	
    fit_grn.py: this file should contain 
    	-code for fitting various grn models given data sources
	-code for manipulating data
	-code for evaluating network performance
	-code for cross-validation
	-code for parameter-estimation

    data_gen.py: this should contain code that creates data from various models

    experiments.py: miscellaneous listing of hopefully documented tests. experiments can contain visualization code, which is likely to be one-off.
